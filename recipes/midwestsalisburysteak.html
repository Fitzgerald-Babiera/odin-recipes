        <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook patties in the hot skillet until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Make the gravy: Melt butter in a separate skillet over medium-high heat. Saut√© mushrooms and onion in melted butter until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir flour and remaining 1/2 packet onion soup mix into mushroom mixture until combined.</li>
